## Abstract
Large dust storms are a common occurrence on Mars. Martian dust devils are known to contribute to
these dust storms and are thought to be an even larger contributor to these storms. The Python
package Muldoon was created to analyze data from the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer
(MEDA) to find these dust devils from wind speed and air pressure data. The extent to which these
dust devils affect Martian atmospheric conditions is currently not well known. Allowing researchers
to analyze this data to search for dust devils helps fill these holes in the data.  

While the Muldoon program is currently capable of generating graphs to visualize the Martian data,
the images are static and can only be viewed locally. The aim of this project is to create an
interactive webpage that can render the Mars 2020 MEDA data graphs dynamically, allowing researchers
to explore the data and collarborate in a more effective manner. Incorporation of Muldoonâ€™s
existing analysis tools will build upon the interactive webpage implementation in the future.
